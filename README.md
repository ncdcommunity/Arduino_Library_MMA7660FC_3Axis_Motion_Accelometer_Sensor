How to Use the MMA7660FC Arduino Library

The MMA7660FC has a number of settings, which can be configured based on user requirements.
          
1.Address calling:The following command is used to call the address of MCP3426 sensor to begin the transmission.

              mma.getAddr_MMA7660FC(MMA7660FC_DEFAULT_ADDRESS_ACCEL);        // 0x4C

2.Sensor setup:The following command is used to measure the output of ADC.

              mma.setUpAccelerometer();
              
3.Output measurement:The following command is used to measure the output of accelometer.

               mma.Measure_Accelerometer();
